## Getting Started
### Thought process on task

#### I wrote this code as if i am an idiot.

    First thing that i did i build whole code from ceasers cypher and went from there. 
    added variable option to choose decrypted or encrypted.
    added loop "do" "while" for number parameters between 1 to 25. (its because there are 26 letters in alphabet)
    added condition "if" "else" choice of decrypted and encrypted message.
    and done.


#####                       Start
