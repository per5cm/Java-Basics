## Start

    Leap year calculation

    Main method.
    Scanner open.
    Program should ask 5 times to enter the year (loop).
    variable "please enter the year".
    
    Condition: year % 400 true, end.
    If no end: year % 100 false, 
    false condition: year % 4 true or false
    
    Scanner close.

    
## Leap year

    If the year is divisible by 400, it is a leap year.
    If the year is divisible by 100 (but not by 400), it is not a leap year.
    If the year is divisible by 4 (but not by 100), it is a leap year.
    If the year does not satisfy any of the above conditions, it is not a leap year.
